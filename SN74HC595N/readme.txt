Standard shift register library, but optimized for big programs.

Should be compatible to most other shift registers similar to the SN74HC595N.


Constructor: shiftReg /name/ (/data pin/, /clock pin/, /output enable pin/, /size of rgister/, \
                                  /most significant (1) of least significant (0) bit first/);


Installing the library:

1. Download the header (.h) and source (.cpp) files and put them into one folder

2. In your Arduino IDE got to 'Sketch' -> 'Import library' and click 'Add library'

3. Go on the folder you put the files in and click 'OK'
