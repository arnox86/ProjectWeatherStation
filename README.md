# Project Weatherstation with Arduino Uno

Here you can see my project to build a small Arduino Uno based weatherstation with temperature, humidity and sunlight exposure sensors plus an LCD-Display.

The code is written in Arduino C++. The libraries should also be compatible to wiringPi C.

Here a list of the used components:
  - DHT11: A pretty accurate temperature an humidity sensor
  - 1608A: A small, but useful LCD display for direct output of the data
  - At least one photoresistor and some other normal resistors


The complete code including the libraries is written by myself.
