# Project weather station with Arduino Uno

Here you can see my project to build a small Arduino Uno based weather station with temperature, humidity and sunlight exposure sensors plus an LCD-Display.

1602A.h is not ready yet, especially the 1602A library has to be developed.

The code is written for Arduino.

In the following a list of the used components:
  - Arduino Uno
  - DHT11: A pretty accurate temperature an humidity sensor
  - 1608A: A small, but useful LCD display for direct output of the data
  - At least one photoresistor and some other normal resistors
  - SN74HC595N: 8 bit shift register
  
In keyword.txt you can find detailed information about the usage of the libraries and their functions.
