# Project Weatherstation with Arduino

Here you can see my project to build a small Arduino based weatherstation with temperature, humidity and sunlight exposure sensors plus an LCD-Display as an output.

The code is written in C++ with Arduino slang.

Here a list of the used components:
  - DHT11: A pretty accurate temperature an humidity sensor
  - 1608A: A small, but useful LCD display for direct output of the data


The complete code including the libraries is written by myself.
